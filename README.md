# FinalQA_AutomationTests

#### All requirements have been met, however it isn't quite what I had hoped for. Here are some changes I plan to make with more time:
  - clean up Page Object Models 
  - better Assertions
  - organize Driver
  
#### Overall just more organization. I had three different projects going which you can tell by the randomness. I made the mistake of trying to go beyond my skillset with my first attempt, so I went back to basics and then tried to update it with what we learned in class. I have learned my lesson. 
##### Thank you for your time.
